# ZARA Inspired Premium Storefront

A luxury, mobile-first single-page storefront inspired by high-end editorial layouts and modular link-in-bio systems.

## 🧠 Access Ladder Philosophy

This storefront is architected around a 3-tier conversion progression designed to build trust and scale revenue:

1.  **Starter (Free)**: Information-only entry point to remove friction and initiate the relationship.
2.  **Pro ($9)**: Low-ticket commitment to validate the user's intent and provide expanded protocol access.
3.  **Elite ($49/mo)**: The core revenue engine. High-leverage continuity program providing full system access.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

- **Data Driven**: All offers are controlled via a strict `offers.json` schema, ensuring modularity and scalability without code sprawl.
- **Micro-Animations**: Uses `framer-motion` for restrained, expensive-feeling transitions.
- **Premium UX**: Implements a shimmer-based skeleton loading state to maintain aesthetic continuity during data hydration.
- **Conversion-Optimized**: Designed for high-authority "Beacons Pro" style conversion while maintaining a "Zara Editorial" aesthetic.
